        description: "Located in the leafy Langata suburb of Nairobi, Giraffe Manor is an exclusive boutique hotel providing luxury 5 star accommodation with a twist. The hotel is a treat in itself, but the real charm lies in its resident herd of endangered Rothschild giraffes, which roam free on the lawns. Although not technically a restaurant, guests can enjoy the unusual experience of interacting with the giraffes whilst they dine, as they're quite content to poke their necks through the windows to share a meal!"

Far more than just 'hot air', her 'culinary ballooning' trips allow up to 14 diners the chance to enjoy nibbles and an aperitif before take-off, followed by a cookery demonstration and stunning 3 course meal prepared in the sky.  The price may be a smidge 'inflated' at £360pp, but then what do you expect? Schmeinck's customised balloon comes fully equipped with all the kitchen essentials, with the open flame doubling up as a blow torch."

Nestled within a limestone cave, looking out across the Adriatic Ocean, this is the perfect location for a truly enchanting evening. Patrons can enjoy a set menu at $100 per person, with delicious seafood delicacies such as Thai Squid or grilled garlic prawns. We can't think of anything better than sitting by the edge of the cave, overlooking the ocean, with a glass of wine and a special someone."

Perched atop a precarious looking rock and surrounded by the Indian Ocean; diners here can enjoy a tantalising array of local seafood dishes whilst taking in the uninterrupted ocean views. It certainly makes a change from the usual TV dinner, we think you'll agree…"

Your meal will be served on a viewing platform overlooking the stunning Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park, where you will be entertained by traditional dance and Didgeridoo performances.

Also boasting the accolade of 'the world's first all-glass undersea restaurant', Ithaa has a beautiful menu of dishes such as Yellow Tail King Fish with Saffron Champagne Rissotto and Beurre Blanc Foam. Translating to 'mother of pearl' in the Maldivian language of Dihevi, you can understand why this restaurant was named after something so beautiful."
